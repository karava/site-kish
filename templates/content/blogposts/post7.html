    <p>Linear models are one of the most basic ways to model/represent data, and are a good starting point for
        machine learning. The algorithms are simple and can be comprehended with a basic understanding of maths.
        LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w_1, ..., w_p) to minimise the
        residual sum of squares between the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the
        linear approximation. This essentially produces a straight-line of best fit. Do not forget, linear regression
        can be multi-dimensional. <img src="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_ols_001.png"

        Linear regression can be easily implemented for simple data that may have a basic correlation in two
        dimensions, for example water usage by household size, house price data, and cancer predictions. To plot
        data, Matplotlib, is a convenient Python 2D plotting library.
