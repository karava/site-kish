    <h2>Jupyter notebook tips for experimentation</h2>

    <h3>%%time</h3>

    <p>Use %%time at the start of cell blocks. Particularly useful when working with large datasets, can extrapolate
    the time for one iteration/batch to calculate the time for entire dataset.</p>

    <h3>tqdm</h3>

    <p>Sets up a progress bar for an iterator, to show progress and estimate time remaining for iterations. Handy to
    get the feel of progress in a cell block, especially for iterating large datasets. Some good instructions can be
        found <a

    <h3>Continuously running Jupyter in the background</h3>

    <p>Consider running Jupyter server continuously in the background, either locally or on a virtual machine. Make
        sure you start the server in the appropriate root folder for your needs. This
        will mean you won't need to keep a terminal with the server running, and this way it keeps your workspace
        clean. Also it's worthwhile creating a bash script to quickly launch the server, so you don't need to
        remember the nohup command.</p>
